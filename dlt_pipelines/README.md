## Next steps

As you are learning the various concepts of data engineering, 
consider creating a portfolio project that will further your own knowledge.

By demonstrating the ability to deliver end to end, you will have an easier time finding your first role. 
This will help regardless of whether your hiring manager reviews your project, largely because you will have a better 
understanding and will be able to talk the talk.
